* Spring 2022 - Lab 08

* Last name: Abushlaih

* First name: David

* Github username: DavidA123777

* Notes: I used a file called main.cpp to call all of the functions which create an output image file. main.cpp uses functions from imageio.cpp and
invert.cpp. I made comments on main.cpp to reflect the names of the files which were created and what each function does.

When you call make and then ./main outImage.pgm
gets created for task A, outImage 2 for task B, outImage3 for task C, outImage4 for task D, outImage5 for task E, and outImage6 for
task F.

They are all based on the image of the cat inImage.pgm and

if you call (make clean) all of these files get removed and you have to do make and ./main
to get these output files again.

* Specific instructions for lab 08

The main lab references an image named *inImage.pgm*. You can download
that or use your own but this repo includes two sample *pgm* (and
*jpg*) files that you can use to test your solution.

The main lab also talks about a file ~lab-images.cpp~. Instead, you
should use the files ~imageio.cpp~ and ~imageio.h~ that are in this
repo. They include  modified versions of readImage and
writeImage. They have been modified to accept a std::string as the
first parameter representing the name of the file to read or write.

There is also an example file: ~sample.cpp~ and a ~Makefile~ that
builds it to show how to use ~imageio.cpp~.

For this lab, instead of writing separate programs, write one program
that you should compile using *make*. You should modify the provided
~Makefile~. For each task, save the resultant (output) image using the
name *taskN.pgm* where N is the task letter (taskA.pgm, taskB.pgm,
etc.).


Important specifics:

1. Your program must use *make* to build it and must include targets
   for *main* which builds the program and *clean* which removes ~.o~
   files.
2. Your program must consist of *at least* two ~.cpp~ files if not
   more, not counting ~imageio.cpp~.
3. You *should not* change anything in ~iamgeio.cpp~.
4. This lab should *not* use ~doctest.h~, it should just run with no
   user input and generate the output images.

5. *DO NOT* add the output images to the repo.
6. If you use another source image for your program. make sure to
   include that in the repo.
